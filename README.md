# TMS Project
This is a Bootstrap-based Project Management System built with Angular. 
In this project I focused on creating reusable solutions and follwed the principles of the Single Responsibility Principle and reducing coupling. 
Here are the interesting concepts used in this project:

* **Presentational Components**
    - Components responsible for rendering UI elements and receiving data through inputs.
  
* **Smart Components** 
    - Components that handle business logic and interact with services and APIs.

* **Reusable Components** 
    - Components designed to be reused in different parts of the application.

* **@Input** 
    - Used to pass data from parent components to child components.
    
* **Custom Directives**
    - Custom directives created to enhance the functionality and behavior of HTML elements.
    
* **Custom Pipes**
    - Custom pipes created for transforming and manipulating data in templates.

* **Interceptors** 
    - Interceptors used for intercepting and modifying HTTP requests and responses.
